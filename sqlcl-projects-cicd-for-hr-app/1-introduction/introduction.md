# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Welcome to this workshop! As a developer at a Tech Company Solutions, you have been assigned the task of adding new features for the HR application. With the company's growth, the complexities of managing both the application and its database have also increased.

While many developers recognize the advantages of CI/CD pipelines for automating application deployments, the integration of database CI/CD is frequently overlooked. Manually managing database updates, rollbacks, and migrations can result in significant errors and delays.
