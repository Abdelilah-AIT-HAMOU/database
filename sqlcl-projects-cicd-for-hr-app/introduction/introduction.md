# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Welcome to this workshop! As a developer at MoroccanTech Solutions, you have been assigned the task of adding new features for the HR application. With the company's growth, the complexities of managing both the application and its database have also increased.

While many developers recognize the advantages of CI/CD pipelines for automating application deployments, the integration of database CI/CD is frequently overlooked. Manually managing database updates, rollbacks, and migrations can result in significant errors and delays. Imagine if the process of managing database changes could be as straightforward as deploying application code.

Introducing **SQLcl Projects Extension** a transformative magical tool designed to enhance database CI/CD. This extension offers automation, consistency, and reliability in database management, enabling developers like you to manage database changes effectively and without the typical challenges.

During this workshop, you will not only work on adding features to the HR application but also discover how the SQLcl Project Extension can transform your database management practices. The main goal of this workshop is to show you how this extension, designed for more than just database applications, can enhance any application that involves database management. We will explore how this robust extension integrates seamlessly with your CI/CD pipeline, facilitating smooth and error-free database deployments across all environments.
