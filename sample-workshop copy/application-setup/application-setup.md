# Getting Started With The Application

## Introduction

This is the time to introduce to you the application you will work on. First you need to setup the application. In this lab, we will show you the app and how to run it.
The application is a react application. If you are not familiar with react don't worry we will give you all you need to succeed on your workshop.

>**Note:** The technology used doesn't matter. The goal of the workshop is not learning you how to develop an application but is to get you now how to develop using SQLcl Project whatever technology used.
