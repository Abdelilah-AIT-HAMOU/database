# Get started - Cloud login

## Introduction

<Oracle Cloud is the industry's broadest and most integrated cloud provider, with deployment options ranging from the public cloud to your data center. Oracle Cloud offers best-in-class services across Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).>
All your work during this workshop will be within the Oracle cloud. Before you get started, you will need an Oracle Cloud account. This lab walks you through the steps of getting an Oracle Cloud Free Tier account and signing in.

11. Your account is provisioning and should be available soon! You might want to log out as you wait for your account to be provisioned. You'll receive an email from Oracle notifying you that provisioning is complete, with your cloud account and username.

## Task 2: Sign in to Your Account

*Please note that while your tenancy is initially created, you will only see a direct login. Once your tenancy is fully provisioned, you will see the screens as described below.*

1. Go to [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com?sourceType=:ow:lp:cpo::::RC_WWMK211125P00013:llid=685). Enter your Cloud Account Name and click **Next**. This is the name you chose while creating your account in the previous section. It's NOT your email address. If you've forgotten the name, see the confirmation email.

    ![Oracle Cloud](./../get-started/images/cloud-oracle.png " ")

2. Choose *"OracleIdentityCloudService"* and click **Next**.

    ![Sign In](./../get-started/images/identity-domain.png =40%x*)

    When you sign up for an Oracle Cloud account, a user is created for you in Oracle Identity Cloud Service with the username and password you selected. You can use this single sign-on option to sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and then navigate to other Oracle Cloud services without re-authenticating. This user has administrator privileges for all the Oracle Cloud services included with your account.

3. Enter your Cloud Account credentials and click **Sign In**. Your username is your email address. The password is what you chose when you signed up for an account.

    ![Username and Password](./../get-started/images/oci-signin.png =40%x*)

4. You will be prompted to enable secure verification. Click **Enable Secure Verification**. For more details, refer the [Managing Multifactor Authentication documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/usingmfa.htm)

    ![Enable secure verification](./../get-started/images/enable-secure-verification.png " ")

5. Select a method - **Mobile App** or **FIDO Authenticator** to enable secure verification.

    ![Choose method](./../get-started/images/select-mfa-method.png " ")

6. If you have chosen:

    * **Mobile App** - Follow the steps as shown in the screenshot to setup authentication.

        ![Mobile App](./../get-started/images/mobile-app-mfa.png " ")

    * **FIDO Authenticator** - Click **Setup** and follow the steps to setup authentication.

        ![FIDO Authenticator](./../get-started/images/fido-mfa.png " ")

7. Once you have verified authentication, you will now be signed in to Oracle Cloud!
